Welcome to the git repository for WordOwl, an iOS word-finding tool and word game companion. WordOwl is capable of searching for words by starting letters, anagrams, letter quantities, contained strings and so much more. WordOwl can help with all kinds of searches, whether you're looking for words containing 'panda', anagrams of 'integral' or words with three pairs of double letters. Users can even build their own search tools using the sophisticated Compound Search mode.
